        <p class="large-paragraph">
            Greetings! I am Mahabali,<br>
            the great king of Kerala, known for my unparalleled devotion to my people and my deep sense of justice.<br>
            My reign was marked by prosperity and harmony, where no one went hungry and all lived in peace.<br>
            However, my humility and dedication to my subjects caught the attention of the gods, leading to my temporary exile.<br>
            Each year, during the festival of Onam, I return to visit my beloved people, bringing joy and celebration.<br>
            <b>Welcome to my realm!</b>
